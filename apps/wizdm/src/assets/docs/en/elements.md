# Elements 
[@wizdm/elements](https://github.com/wizdmio/wizdm/tree/master/libs/elements/src/lib) 

Elements is a collection of UI components designed to extend and blend-in with [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) components sharing the sames theming model and coloring scheme. 

Similarly to material components, every Elements' component uses `ViewEncapsulation.None` in order to get styled globally. Make sure to include the `wm-elements-theme()` mixin available from `_elements-theming.scss` in the main styling scss file of your project.
