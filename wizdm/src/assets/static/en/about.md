# About Wizdm

Wizdm is a boilerplate to kickstart serverless single page applications based on [Angular](https://angular.io) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com). Designed to help aspiring startuppers bootstrapping their side projects into functioning prototypes ready to launch in the shortest possible time.

## Feature rich

Wizdm comes packed with all the essential features of a modern single page application ready to be used including account management and user authentication, cloud file storage and real-time data synchronization, user interface theming and internationalization and much more.

## Zero starting costs

At the very core of this initiative there's the willing to provide a "zero starting cost" solution while granting performances, compatibility and top level support - meaning - all the technologies, platforms and services involved in wizdm development have been selected by reputation and by the availability of generous freemium subscription options.
