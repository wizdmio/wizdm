# Multiple Languages
Wizdm is designed to provide runtime content in multiple languages selecting the proper language by means of a route parameter placed at the very root of the url like "https\://mycooldomain.io/**en**/home" for English and "https\://mycooldomain.io/**it**/home" for italian. 

To achieve it, the app complies with the following pattern:

<-

The AppComponent template contains the first `<router-outlet>` where the *Router* will load a *NavigatorComponent*. The routing path of the *NavigatorComponent* is the `:lang` token, so, the *Router* will store the language code within a parameter (named *lang*) in the activated route. The *NavigatorComponent* template contains the second `<router-outlet>` where the router will load the actual pages, so, both the navigator and the pages weâ€™ll have the opportunity to dynamically load their content based on the language code.
